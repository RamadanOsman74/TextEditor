# Content Editor Security Guide

This guide provides essential security measures to protect content editors like **Quill** from common vulnerabilities, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and content injection attacks.

## Security Features of Quill Editor

- **Secure by Default**: Quill outputs sanitized data by default, reducing the risk of XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Strict HTML Policies**: You can customize what content is allowed and restrict potentially dangerous tags.
- **Escaping Content**: Quill automatically escapes inserted content, making it safer to embed in applications.

## Testing Security in Your Editor

### 1. Content Security
#### XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- Ensure that any HTML or script content users input is sanitized to prevent malicious code injection.
- **Sanitization**: Use a library like [Ganss.XSS](https://github.com/mganss/HtmlSanitizer) in .NET to clean HTML content before saving it.


### 2. File Upload Security

## Allowed File Types
- Restrict file uploads to specific types (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`) to reduce risk from potentially harmful files.

#### Limit File Size
- Set a maximum file upload size to prevent large files that could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
- **Recommended limit:** 10 MB
